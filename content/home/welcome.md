Clinical severity scores facilitate standardized quantitative comparison of disease severity between groups of patients to understand risk factors for severe illness and evaluate treatment efficacy. 

Relevant severity scoring tools provide reliable discrimination across the spectrum of illness severity and are parsimonious, easy to use, and universally applicable. 

Prior mpox severity scores, based on numbers of skin lesions and individual functional capacity, have been less applicable to the 2022 outbreak.

The **MPOX Severity Scoring System (MPOX-SSS)** was developed specifically for the 2022 outbreak. 

Aï»¿n abstract has been submitted to CROI and more information will be posted here after CROI 2023.
